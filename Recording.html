      <h1>Recording</h1>
      <p>First step, setting the BPM and time signature, which is at the top of the mixer.
        <br>
        <br><img src="reaper-bpm-800x419.png" alt="mixer example" width="800" height="418">
        <br>
        <br>Click on the BPM box to type in the desired tempo.
        <br>
        <br>Next to that, is the time signature box. Click it to change the signature.
        <br>
        <br>Next, we enable the track for recording. To do this go to your track and hit the dark red circle. It will turn on, indicating that its ready for recording.
        <br>Click on the megaphone on the track to enable record monitoring.
        <br>
        <br><img src="record-monitoring-800x413.png" alt="track example" width="800" height="418">
        <br>
        <br>You'll also see an M and S under the red circle, these mean mute and solo buttons.
        <br>
        <br>Once you record your audio, you might need to loop it to fit the entire song length.
        <br>
        <br>To loop a section:
        <ul>
          <li>Left-click in the area above the tracks</li>
          <li>Drag your mouse left or right</li>
          <li>Select the timeframe to loop</li>
          <li>Hit R or the Toggle Repeat button</li>
        </ul>
        <br>When you record or play the track, it will loop that section. When you record while looping, it will automatically record a new take with every loop.
        <br>

      <h1>Editing</h1>
      <p>After recording your first track, its time to edit it.
        <br><b>To cut or split an item</b>, simply click on the spot you want to make a split.
        <br>
        <br>Your cursor will snap to the grid, you can turn this on or off using Alt+S.
        <br>
        <br>To make the split just hit S or right-click and choose "Split items at cursor".
        <br>
        <br><img src="reaper-snap-button-800x417.png" alt="Split button example" width="800" height="418">
        <br>
        <br>If you don't want to do that, you can also drag the edge of the item forward or backward to remove that part of the item.
        <br>
        <br>This doesn't get rid of the item, so if you did it by mistake, you can just re-drag the item back.
        <br>
        <br><img src="splitting-tracks-800x418.png" alt="splitting tracks" width="800" height="418">
        <br>
        <br><b>You can also stretch an item</b>, which speeds up or slows down the audio.
        <br>
        <br>Hover on the edge of an item, press and hold <b>Alt</b>, and click and drag the edge.(Note: this will diminish the quality of the audio.)
        <br>
        <br><b>Nudging</b> is another useful feature that REAPER has. This is used for shifting items exactly where you want them to go.
        <br>
        <br>Just click on the item, hold <b>Shift</b> and press left or right arrows. This will nudge the item slightly left or right.
        <br>
        <br>If it isn't as accurate as you would like, you can always <b>zoom</b> by scrolling up or down with your mouse wheel.
        <br>
        <br>Another basic feature is <b>crossfading</b>.
        <br>
        <br>When you drag an item over another it will automatically apply crossfade. You can also manually adjust this crossfade.
        <br>
        <br>Hover over the top corner of the items overlapping each other. Click and drag to change the crossfades length.
        <br>This is also how you fade an item in or out.
        <br>
        <br><img src="crossfade-800x418.png" alt="crossfade example" width="800" height="418">
        <br>
        <br>You can also <b>highlight multiple items</b> over multiple tracks. There are a few ways to do this.
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Right-click and drag your mouse across all items you want to select</li>
          <li>Use Ctrl/Shift and click the items you want to select</li>
          <li>Left-click and drag your mouse on the section that shows both time and measures</li>
          <li>Hit Ctrl+Shift+C(copy) or Ctrl+Shift+X(cut)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>These will allow you to shorten, split or move items around in your track.
        <br>
        <br>To adjust <b>gain levels and panning</b>, you can access those on the left side where the tracks list is, or at the mixer at the bottom.
        <br>
        <br>All these features also have <b>shortcuts</b>. You can also make these shortcuts custom.
        <br>
        <br>Go to Actions -> Show action list, then select the action you want to give a shortcut to. Click on "Add...." type in the shortcut key(s), then hit OK.
        <br>
        <br>The last useful tool I'll discuss are <b>envelopes</b>. You can use these to adjust settings on a track at different parts of the track.
        <br>This includes things like <b>volume panning and automation</b>.
