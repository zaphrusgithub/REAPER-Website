      <p>REAPER comes with plugins built it to modify music. These plugins called ReaPlugs are free to download and are highly configurable to do exactly what the user wants them to do. If you don't find a plug-in you need within ReaPlugs,
         you can download hundreds of JSFX plug-ins which are also entirely customizable. These additional plugins feature plug-ins from simple audio effects (e.g delay, distortion, compression) to instruments themselves. 
         You can also record audio yourself into REAPER if you have that instrument and equipment on hand. REAPER is compatible with the vast majority of free and commerial plug-ins availible.
         REAPER also allows importing of all commonly used media types: MP3, MIDI, Video etc.
